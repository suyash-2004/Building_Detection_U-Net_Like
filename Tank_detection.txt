	for tank detection - the height will be around - 150meters.
for weapons detection - out height will be = 30-50 meters.

the drone will be given a boundary set to keep surveillance on that area and keep looking for tanks and weapons.
once the drone detects any thing, it will send the coordinates to the ground station and an image of the detection that it has done.
then from the ground station a person can analyse that image and take a decision to drop a bomb on that tank or to ignore it and keep surveillance

Challenges in models performance :
camera quality - optical zoom?
air visibility
terrain
